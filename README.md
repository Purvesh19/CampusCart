## Campus Cart
Igniting Campus Connections with Empowered Commerce.

## What we are doing?
College students lack a reliable and user-friendly platform to buy, sell, and rent products within their campus community. Existing solutions fail to provide clear product distinctions and the ability to post demands for unavailable items.

CampusCart fills this void by offering an intuitive website where students can seamlessly engage in transactions and post requests for specific items, fostering a collaborative marketplace within their college.
CampusCart addresses the challenges faced by college students, providing a streamlined and inclusive platform that revolutionizes campus commerce.

## Problems We Are Solving
Our website addresses the problem of college students struggling to find a reliable platform to buy, sell, and rent products. By providing a dedicated marketplace, we simplify the process and ensure a secure and convenient experience for all users. Our website not only focuses on buying, selling, and renting products but also promotes sustainable usage and financial literacy. We encourage users to donate items they no longer need, fostering a culture of reuse. Additionally, we provide features like negotiation for financial literacy to empower students in making informed financial decisions.
